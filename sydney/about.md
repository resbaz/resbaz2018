# About

The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2018 ResBaz events will be held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

ResBaz Sydney will be hosted by Macquarie University. It is organised and sponsored by University of Technology Sydney, The University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, Western Sydney University, and Macquarie University.

### What is the Research Bazaar?

The Research Bazaar is a free, 3-day intensive festival and conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. Activities include:

* Software Carpentry workshops (R, Python, SQL, Shell, Git)
* Getting the most out of your data (with Excel, OpenRefine and R)
* eResearch services & tools (HPC, NecTAR, tech info booths)
* Social activities (daytime & evening)
* The Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp)

The program is still in the making, and will appear soon.

### Who should attend?

Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!

ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools.
