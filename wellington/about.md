The Wellington Research Bazaar is a conference promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn new skills, showcase current projects, and share knowledge.
