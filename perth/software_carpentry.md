## Day 1 & 2: Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and the advanced stream

Over the first two days of the event, two Software Carpentry and one Data Carpentry workshops will run simultaneously. These hands-on workshops will cover basic computer programming concepts and tools for researchers, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. Participants can elect to participate in either the Python stream or R stream.

The Data Carpentry workshop will focus on genomics and bioinformatics tools on the command line.

Simultaneously there will be an advanced stream for those who already have experience with programming or have participated in a Software Carpentry workshop before. This stream is hosted by The Pawsey Supercomputing Centre. Click on the classes' names to see what they are about!
