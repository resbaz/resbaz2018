# Website for ResBaz 2018

This repository contains the code for the [ResBaz 2018 website](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/).

For those familiar with the websites from previous years,
this is a polymer-based rewrite which will hopefully be easier to work with.

## Creating a new site page using our template

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new folder using the name of your city
3. Copy and edit the contents of an existing city folder*
4. Submit a pull request 

*To preview what your page will look like,
navigate to the forked version of the website
by replacing the username and city details in the following URL:
`https://username.github.io/resbaz2018/city/`

Once your pull request has been accepted,
your page will go live on the actual ResBaz 2018 website.
You (or a nominated person from your organising team)
will then be added as a collaborator to this repository so that
you can make future edits to your page directly
rather than submitting a pull request every time.

If you have any problems following these instructions,
please feel free to create a new issue using the tab at the top of the page.

## Creating your own site page

In previous years, some sites have prefered to create their own event website
(e.g. hosted on their university webiste).
You are more than welcome to do this - simply tell us the URL
(by opening a new issue above)
so that we can link to your site from the main ResBaz website
and place a corresponding pin on the map.
